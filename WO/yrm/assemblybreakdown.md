## Assembly Code Breakdown: Rust-Compiled Function `play5`

### Function Signature & Prologue
```assembly
.section .text.yrm::w1::play5,"ax",@progbits
.p2align 4, 0x90
.type   yrm::w1::play5,@function
yrm::w1::play5:
```
- Defines the **function `play5`** in the `.text` section (the **code section** in memory).
- `.p2align 4, 0x90` ensures **16-byte alignment** for performance.
- `.type yrm::w1::play5,@function` declares that `play5` is a **function symbol**.

---

### Function Entry (Stack Setup)
```assembly
.cfi_startproc
push rax
.cfi_def_cfa_offset 16
```
- `.cfi_startproc` marks the start of the function for debugging & exception handling.
- `push rax` saves `rax` on the **stack** (not heap!). This is likely for **temporary storage** or **alignment**.
- `.cfi_def_cfa_offset 16` tells the **debugging system** that the stack pointer is now **16 bytes offset** (since `push rax` adjusts the stack by 8 bytes).

---

### Loading a Constant into a Register
```assembly
movabs rax, 68719476752
```
- **Moves the absolute 64-bit value `68719476752` into `rax`**.
- This is **not** allocating memory in the heap‚Äîit's just loading a number into a register.
- If `68719476752` represents a **memory address**, `rax` is now a **pointer** to it.

---

### Storing the Value on the Stack (Variable Assignment)
```assembly
mov qword ptr [rsp], rax
```
- Stores the **value in `rax`** (68719476752) at **the stack location pointed to by `rsp`** (top of the stack).
- In Rust:
  ```rust
  let point2 = point;
  ```
  This **copies** `point` into `point2`.

---

### Passing a Pointer to the Function Argument
```assembly
mov rdi, rsp
```
- Moves the **address of the stack variable** (point2) into `rdi`.
- **Why?** Because in the **x86-64 System V calling convention**, the first function argument is passed in `rdi`.
- This means the function `print_bytes(&point2)` is getting a **pointer to point2** (which lives on the stack).

---

### Calling Another Function (`print_bytes`)
```assembly
call yrm::print::print_bytes
```
- Calls the function `yrm::print::print_bytes` to **print the bytes of `point2`**.
- `print_bytes` will read the **stack value at `[rsp]`**, treating it as a memory address or data.

---

### Function Cleanup (Stack Restore & Return)
```assembly
pop rax
.cfi_def_cfa_offset 8
ret
```
- `pop rax`: **Restores the original value of `rax`** (undoing the earlier `push rax`).
- `.cfi_def_cfa_offset 8`: Debugging directive to **restore stack state**.
- `ret`: **Return from the function**, jumping back to the caller.

---

## Summary of What This Function Does
1. **Push `rax`** to stack for alignment.
2. **Load `68719476752` into `rax`**.
3. **Store `rax` into the stack** (creating a local variable `point2`).
4. **Pass a pointer to `point2` in `rdi`**.
5. **Call `print_bytes` to print it**.
6. **Restore stack & return**.

## Key Takeaways
‚úÖ **Does this allocate heap memory?**
‚ùå **No.** This only works with the **stack** (`rsp`), and there‚Äôs no dynamic memory allocation like `malloc` or `Box::new()`.

‚úÖ **What does `movabs rax, 68719476752` do?**
- Just **loads a constant** into `rax`. It **doesn't allocate memory**.

‚úÖ **Where is the memory stored?**
- Everything here is stored **on the stack** (`rsp`), including `point2`.
