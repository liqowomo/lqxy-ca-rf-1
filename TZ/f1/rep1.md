# High Issues

## H-1: ETH transferred without address checks

Consider introducing checks for `msg.sender` to ensure the recipient of the money is as intended.

</details>



# Low Issues

## L-1: Unspecific Solidity Pragma

Consider using a specific version of Solidity in your contracts instead of a wide version. For example, instead of `pragma solidity ^0.8.0;`, use `pragma solidity 0.8.0;`

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/r1.sol [Line: 2](src/r1.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.18;
	```

</details>



## L-2: Address State Variable Set Without Checks

Check for `address(0)` when assigning values to address state variables.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/r1.sol [Line: 102](src/r1.sol#L102)

	```solidity
	        store = EtherStore(_store);
	```

</details>



## L-3: Public Function Not Used Internally

If a function is marked public but is not used internall, consider marking it as `external`.

<details><summary>8 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/r1.sol [Line: 33](src/r1.sol#L33)

	```solidity
	    function deposit() public payable {
	```

	```solidity
	    function Attack() public {
	```

</details>



## L-4: Literal Instead of Constant

Define and use `constant` variables instead of using literals. If the same constant literal value is used multiple times, create a constant state variable and reference it throughout the contract.

<details><summary>2 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/r1.sol [Line: 83](src/r1.sol#L83)

	```solidity
	        vm.deal(address(store), 5 ether);
	```

- Found in src/r1.sol [Line: 84](src/r1.sol#L84)

	```solidity
	        vm.deal(address(storeRemediated), 5 ether);
	```

</details>



## L-5: Empty `require()` / `revert()` Statement

Use descriptive reason strings or custom errors for revert paths.

<details><summary>2 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/r1.sol [Line: 38](src/r1.sol#L38)

	```solidity
	        require(balances[msg.sender] >= _weiToWithdraw);
	```

	```solidity
	        require(balances[msg.sender] >= _weiToWithdraw);
	```

</details>



## L-6: PUSH0 Opcode

Solc compiler version 0.8.20 switches the default target EVM version to Shanghai, which means that the generated bytecode will include PUSH0 opcodes. Be sure to select the appropriate EVM version in case you intend to deploy on a chain other than mainnet like L2 chains that may not support PUSH0, otherwise deployment of your contracts will fail.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/r1.sol [Line: 2](src/r1.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.18;
	```

</details>



## L-7: Modifier Invoked Only Once

Consider removing the modifier or inlining the logic into the calling function.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/r1.sol [Line: 53](src/r1.sol#L53)

	```solidity
	    modifier nonReentrant() {
	```

</details>



## L-8: State Change Without Event

There are state variable changes in this function but no event is emitted. Consider emitting an event to enable offchain indexers to track the changes.

<details><summary>7 Found Instances</summary>

## L-9: State Variable Could Be Immutable

State variables that are only changed in the constructor should be declared immutable to save gas. Add the `immutable` attribute to state variables that are only changed in the constructor
